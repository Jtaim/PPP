	Section 8 Exercise 13
	Can we declare a non-reference function const (e.g., void f(const int);)?
	- yes.
	What might that mean?
	- read only argument.  functional will not modify the argument is a compiler error if you try.
	Why don't people do that often?
	- not sure but should always assign as const if function is not modifying an argument.
